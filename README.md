# Frequency detector written in rust

This project started out as a simple humming detector written in rust but, ended up becoming a frequency analyser that uses a Fourier transform to obtain the frequencies of the sound that is being recorded.

But the main goals of the project were still accomplished:

- Improve rust skills
- Learn how to record audio using rust (in Linux)
- Learn the mathematical bases of a Fourier transform

#How to run

```bash
cargo run
```
